# UX audits app - my Bachelor's thesis

Web application created as Bachelos thesis *(Development of tools for expert review of user interfaces)*. Project wasn't written in the best way, without newest tools as for example webpack, which might be usefull. Application works fine, but one day I would like to rewrite it to ES6+ and use more advance techniques.

## Functionalities

Main purpose was to create application which might be usefull during making UX audits. In this project user can achieve that goal using two techniques: heuristics evaluation and checklists. In addition he can use built-in notepad and page browser. He can adjust UI to his needs. After work, he can save progress and export it to .docx format.
